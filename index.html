    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent approach to the storage
        of digital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term
        object management best practices within digital repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
        This specification covers two principle areas:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Structure. A normative specification of the nature of an OCFL Object (the "object-at-rest");</li>
        <li>Client Behaviors. A set of recommendations for how OCFL Objects should be acted upon (the
            "object-in-motion")
        </li>
    </ol>
    <section id="need">
        <h2>Need</h2>
        <p>The OCFL initiative arose from a need to have well-defined application-independent file management within
           digital repositories.</p>
        <p>A general observation is that the contents of a digital repository -- that is, the digital files and metadata
           that an institution might wish to manage -- are largely stable. Once content has been accessioned, it is
           unlikely to change significantly over its lifetime. This is in contrast to the software applications that
           manage these contents, which are ephemeral, requiring constant updating and replacement. Thus, transitions
           between application-specific methods of file management to support software upgrades and replacement cycles
           can be seen as unnecessary and risky change, changing the long-term stable objects to support the short-term,
           ephemeral software.</p>
        <p>By providing a specification for the file-and-folder layout on disk, the OCFL is an attempt at reducing, or
           even eliminating, the need for these transitions. As an application-independent specification, conforming
           applications will natively "understand" the underlying file structure without needing to first transition
           these contents to their own format.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
</section>

<section id="object-spec">
    <h2>Object Specification</h2>
    <p>
        An OCFL Object is a group of one or more content bitstreams (data and metadata), and their administrative
        information that are together identified by a URI. The object may contain a sequence of versions of the
        bitstreams that represent the evolution of the object's contents.
    </p>

    <section id="basic-structure">
        <h2>Basic Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The basic OCFL Object structure has a minimal set of files and folders necessary to support data storage and
            object validation. The minimum required is shown in the following figure:
        </p>
        <pre>
[object_root]
    ├── 0=ocfl_object_1.0
    ├── inventory.jsonld
    ├── inventory.jsonld.sha512
    ├── logs
    │   └── .keep
    └── v1
        ├── inventory.jsonld
        └── inventory.jsonld.sha512
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="object-conformance-declaration">
        <h2>Object Conformance Declaration</h2>
        <p>
            The version declaration MUST be formatted according to the [[!NAMASTE]] specification. It MUST be an empty
            file in the base directory of the object giving the OCFL object version in the filename. The filename MUST
            be constructed with a leading zero-equals (<code>0=</code>) string, the string <code>ocfl_object_</code>,
            followed by the OCFL specification version number. For example <code>0=ocfl_object_1.0</code> for version
            1.0 of this specification.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="logs-directory">
        <h2>Logs Directory</h2>
        <p>
            The base directory of the object MAY contain a logs directory, which MAY be empty. Implementers SHOULD use
            this for storing files that contain a record of actions taken on the object. Since these logs may be subject
            to local standards requirements, the format of these logs is considered out-of-scope for the OCFL Object.
            Clients operating on the object MAY log actions here that are not otherwise captured.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>
                The purpose of the logs directory is to provide implementers with a location for storing local
                information about actions to the object that may not necessarily be part of the object itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, implementers may have different local requirements to store audit information for their
                digital objects. Some may wish to store a log entry indicating that an audit was conducted, and
                nothing was wrong, while others may wish to only store a log entry if an intervention was required.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Top-level Inventory</h2>

        <section id="top-level-inventory-digest">
            <h2>Top-level Inventory Digest</h2>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section id="versions-directories">
        <h2>Versions Directories</h2>
        <p>
            OCFL object content is stored as a sequence of one or more versions. Each object version is stored in a
            version directory under the object root. The sequence of version numbers is the sequence of positive
            integers: 1, 2, 3, etc., and the version directory name is constructed by adding the prefix <code>v</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implementations SHOULD use version directory names constructed without zero-padding the
            version number, ie. <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>, <code>v3</code>, etc..
        </p>
        <p>
            For compatibility with existing filesystem conventions, implementations MAY use zero-padded version numbers,
            with the following restriction: If zero-padded version numbers are used then they MUST start with a zero.
            For example, in an implementation that uses five digits the version directory names <code>v00001</code> to
            <code>v09999</code> are allowed, <code>v10000</code> is not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first version of an object defines the naming convention for all versions of the object. All versions of
            an object MUST use the same naming convention: either a non-padded version number, or a zero-padded version
            number of consistent length. Operations that add a new version to an object MUST follow the directory naming
            convention established by earlier versions. In all cases, references to files inside version directories
            from inventory files MUST use the actual version directory names.
        </p>
    </section>

<section id="inventory">
    <h2>OCFL Object Inventory</h2>

    <p>
        An OCFL Object Inventory MUST follow the [[!JSON]] structure described in this section and MUST be named
        <code>inventory.jsonld</code>. Furthermore, inventory files MUST conform to [[!JSON-LD-1.1]], MUST include
        the JSON-LD <code>@context</code> value
        <a href="context.jsonld"><code>https://ocfl.io/context.jsonld</code></a>.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="informative">
        Non-normative note: The use of JSON-LD for inventory files means that they can be generated from and interpreted
        as RDF, and provides some self-documentation. The fixed JSON structure means that they can also be generated and
        read without requiring RDF and JSON-LD support.
    </blockquote>

    <section id="inventory-structure">
        <h2>Basic Structure</h2>
    </section>

    <section id="digest-algorithm-choice">
        <h2>Digest Algorithm Choice</h2>
        <p>
            Digests play two roles in an OCFL Object. The first is that digests allow for content-addressable storage;
            that is, for a file to be addressed by the digest of its contents, rather than its filename. The second is
            that digests provide for fixity checks to determine whether a file has become corrupt through hardware
            degradation or malicious actors.
        </p>
        <p>
            OCFL Objects SHOULD use SHA512 by default. The choice of SHA512 recognizes that it has no known collision
            vulnerabilities and is less computationally intensive to compute than SHA256.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it is acknowledged that this may be a significant barrier for legacy content migration and
            consistency. Implementers may thus choose from the following list of digest algorithms:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Digest Algorithm</th>
                <th>Note</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>md5</td>
                <td>Insecure. Use only for legacy content.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>sha1</td>
                <td>Insecure. Use only for legacy content.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>sha256</td>
                <td>Non-truncated only; note performance implications.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>sha512</td>
                <td>Default choice. Non-truncated forms only.</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            Implementers MAY wish to store their file digests in a system external to their OCFL object stores at the
            point of ingest, to further safeguard against the possibility of malicious manipulation of file contents and
            digests.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="digest-sidecar-file">
        <h2>Digest Sidecar File</h2>
        <p>
            Every occurrence of an inventory file MUST have an accompanying sidecar file stating its digest. This
            sidecar file must be of the form <code>inventory.jsonld.ALGORITHM</code>, where <code>ALGORITHM</code> is
            the chosen digest algorithm for the object. An example might be <code>inventory.jsonld.sha512</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The digest sidecar file MUST contain the digest of the inventory file. This MUST follow the format
            <code>DIGEST inventory.jsonld</code>; that is, the digest of the inventory file, a single space, and the
            name of the inventory file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The digest of the inventory MUST be computed only after all changes to the inventory have been made, so this
            sidecar file SHOULD be created as the last step in the versioning process.
