    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This document provides guidance on implementation of the [[OCFL-Specification]] for how clients should behave
        when operating on OCFL Objects.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="sotd">
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Digital Preservation</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Rebuildability</h2>
      <p>
        A key goal of the OCFL is the rebuildability of a repository from an OCFL storage root without additional
        information resources. Consequently, a key implementation consideration should be to ensure that OCFL objects
        contain all the data and metadata required to achieve this. With reference to the [[OAIS]] model, this would
        include all the descriptive, administrative, structural, representation, and preservation metadata relevant to
        the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, as an aid to those who may need to recover OCFL objects in the future, it is recommended that a
        copy of the [[OCFL-Specification]] is stored in the top level of the OCFL storage root. The OCFL ignores files
        other than the conformance declaration at the top level so it is a good location to store documentation that
        may be useful for recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more complete approach would be to create a specific OCFL object that contains this documentation and to have
        a pointer to its location in the storage root. This documentation object would then be subject to OCFL
        validation and any other digital preservation processes that might be implemented without requiring special
        handling.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="fixity">
      <h2>Fixity</h2>
      <p>
        The digests in the manifest are used by the OCFL for content addressability rather than fixity but they are
        suitable for use as part of a fixity regime, and the manifest block usefully identifies all the files in an
        object. OCFL validation also requires that digests and files match. However, while the characteristics of digest
        algorithms that make them suitable for fixity checking and content addressing are closely related, they are not
        identical. In particular, fixity against malicious tampering requires that a digest computation is hard to
        reverse, which is not a requirement for content addressing. It is this aspect which is the most frequent target
        for cryptoanalytic attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, it is sensible to allow additional or alternative fixity algorithms to be used. These may be made
        in a <a href="../spec/#fixity">fixity block</a> which has the same layout as a manifest block but permits a
        broader range of algorithms. The OCFL will consider a fixity block valid if all the files referenced in the
        block exist but the OCFL does not validate digests for all possible algorithms. The fixity block does not have
        to include all the files in an object to permit legacy fixity to be imported without requiring continued use of
        obsolete digest algorithms.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Object Contents</h2>
      <p>
        The OCFL separates the content path of stored files from the logical path of these files' content in
        OCFL object versions. This is a key feature that allows previous versions of objects to remain immutable but
        permitting deduplication, forward delta differencing, and easy file renaming. Consequently, the OCFL only
        requires that files added to any version of an OCFL object must be stored somewhere within the relevant version
        directory, with a corresponding entry in the manifest block. An entry in the state block determines the path
        and name of the file within that version by referencing the manifest entry, not the actual path on disk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most transparent approach is to have the path used to store the file on disk the same as the path of the
        file within the object when accessioned. This is readily understandable in terms of visual inspection of the
        physical filesystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this is not always possible. For example, complex objects with deep file hierarchies may encounter
        issues if they come from a fileystem that allows longer paths than are supported by the target OCFL system. In
        this case, the decoupling between content paths and logical paths in OCFL objects allows the use of
        truncated paths for storage while the full paths can be preserved in state block entries which are not length
        constrained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another use case is importing content from other repository systems which renames files on ingest and stores
        them in a flat hierarchy. These can be imported, as is, and the original paths and file names recorded through
        suitable state block entries rather than reconstructing a physical file layout. Of course, the OCFL supports
        ongoing use of such a methodology.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Data and Metadata</h2>
        <p>
          OCFL object versions are composed of series of files/bitstreams but the OCFL does not make any distinction
          between different types of files other than those reserved for OCFL functionality: the inventory, its digest
          file, and conformance declaration files. It is possible, for example, to create separate data and metadata
          directories within each version to help organize material but all files are treated equally for the purpose
          of OCFL validation and management.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Deduplication</h2>
        <p>
          The OCFL supports optional deduplication if a client ensures that all digests in the manifest block refer to a
          single file path on disk. This entry is created the first time file content is stored in an OCFL Object.
          Subsequent references to that file content should then occur in the state block only. This can be determined
          by computing the digests of incoming files and determining if they already exist in the manifest block.
        </p>
        <p>
          If deduplication is carried out within an object then, for consistency, it is expected that Forward Delta
          differencing will also be used between object versions so subsequent references to duplicated content should
          also refer back to the original manifest entry rather than updating it to include additional references.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Filesystem metadata</h2>
        <p>
          Filesystem metadata (e.g. permissions, access, and creation times) are not considered portable between
          filesystems or preservable through file transfer operations. Nor can these attributes be validated in terms of
          fixity in a consistent manner. As such, the OCFL neither explicitly supports nor expects that these attributes
          remain consistent. If retaining this metadata is important then files should either be encapsulated in a
          filesystem image format that preserves this information, or the metadata extracted and stored explicitly in an
          additional file.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Empty Directories</h2>
        <p>
          The OCFL preserves files and their content, with directories serving as a useful organizational convention. An
          empty directory consists only of filesystem metadata and therefore, as noted above, is not amenable to direct
          preservation in OCFL objects. If the preservation of empty directories is considered essential then the
          suggested route is to insert a zero length file named <code>.keep</code> into the directory which will ensure
          directories are preserved as part of the file's path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <code>.keep</code> files are not considered special by the OCFL in any way and are treated exactly
          the same way as other files. As such, a non-zero length <code>.keep</code> file is not considered invalid.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Objects with Many Small Files</h2>
        <p>
          Objects that contain a large number of files can pose performance problems if they are stored in a
          filesystem as-is. Fixity checks, object validation and version creation can require an OCFL client to
          process all the files in an object which can be time consuming. Additionally, most storage systems have a
          minimum block size for allocation to files, so a large number of small files can end up occupying a volume
          of storage significantly larger than the sum of the individual file sizes. In this case, assuming that the
          majority of the files are relatively static data that is unlikely to change between objects versions, it
          is sensible to package the static files together in a single, larger file (zip is recommended). This can
          be parsed to extract individual files if necessary but can significantly improve the efficiency of basic
          OCFL client and storage operations.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Storage Root Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>
        Strictly speaking, the OCFL only requires that an OCFL Storage Root contains OCFL Objects in directories,
        distributed in some manner in the underlying filesystem. In turn, an OCFL object is identified purely by
        the presence of a [[NAMASTE]] conformance file in the object root. The presence and correctness of
        inventory files and version directories are a validation rather than an identification concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        These definitions allow a lot of freedom as to how objects are arranged beneath an OCFL Storage
        Root and, while there is no strict requirement for all OCFL Objects to be arranged according the same
        system it is nevertheless considered good practice to do so. In addition, in the interests of
        rebuildability, it would be prudent to include an indication of the details of this arrangement
        alongside the OCFL specification as described in the Rebuildability section.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the interests of transparency it makes sense for an object's URI, its unique identifier and
        its location under the OCFL Storage Root to be aligned and simply derivable from each other. Good
        examples include:
      </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Flat: Each object is contained in a directory with a name that is simply derived from the
            unique identifier of the object, possibly with the escaping or replacement of characters that are not
            permitted in file and directory names. While this is a very simple approach, most filesystems begin
            to encounter performance issues when directories contain more than a few thousand files so
            this arrangement is best suited to repositories with a small number of objects (or many
            OCFL Storage Roots).

            PairTree: [[PairTree]] is designed to overcome the limitations on the number of files in a
            directory that most file systems have. It creates hierarchy of directories by mapping identifier
            strings to directory paths two characters at a time. For numerical identifiers specified in
            hexadecimal this means that there are a maximum of 256 items in any directory which is well
            within the capacity of any modern filesystem. However, for long identifiers, pairtree creates
            a large number of directories which will be sparsely populated unless the number of objects
            is very large. Traversing all these directories during validation or rebuilding operations can
            be slow.

            Truncated n-tuple Tree: This approach aims to achieve some of the scalability benefits of
            PairTree whilst limiting the depth of the resulting directory hierarchy. To achieve this,
            the source identifier can be split at a higher level of granularity, and only a limited
            number of the identifier digits are used to generate directory paths. For example, using
            triples and three levels with example above yields:

        Some identifier schemes may require transformation before such approaches can be used effectively. A simple
        example would be sequentially assigned identifiers, which would not distribute objects within the filesystem
        evenly. Hash functions may be used to provide a unidirectional mapping between URI/PID and filesystem path,
        as required by the OCFL. Encryption algorithms may be used to provide a bi-directional mapping which may be
        a useful aid to human readability. Relevant details should be referenced in <code>ocfl_layout.json</code>
        in the Storage Root.

      <h2>Filesystem Features</h2>
      <p>
        In order to be portable across as many filesystems as possible, the OCFL makes use of a subset of filesystem
        features that are very broadly supported. It is therefore strongly advised to not use additional features in
        OCFL Storage Roots since OCFL clients and other filesystem tools that need to operate between different
        filesystems may exhibit unpredictable behaviour when feature sets do not match. In particular, using features
        such as hard and soft (symbolic) links for deduplication can work at odds with the OCFL's own mechanisms and
        should be avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consideration should also be given to calculations of storage usage when migrating between filesystems. Many
        back-end filesystem features, which are essentially invisible to user-space code, can have a significant
        impact on the actual consumption of storage space compared with the a simple sum of file sizes. Compression,
        extents and block sub-allocation are examples of such features which, while providing benefits in terms of
        storage efficiency, do require care when considering issues of capacity planning or migration.

    <h2>Client Behaviors</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Basic File Operations</h2>
      <p>
        The OCFL and its inventory structure are designed to support and capture the following file operations
        that create OCFL versions, regardless of whether optional features, such as deduplication, are used.
        The OCFL is not concerned with the process of creating versions but only the final outcome in terms of
        the differences with the previous version that need to be recorded and preserved.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inheritance: By default a new version of an OCFL Object inherits all the filenames and file
          content from the previous version. This serves as the basis against which changes are applied
          to create a new version. A newly created OCFL Object, obviously, inherits no content and is
          populated by file additions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Addition: Adds a new file path and corresponding content to an OCFL Object. The path cannot
          exist in the previous version of the object, and the content cannot have existed in any
          earlier versions of the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Updating: Changes the content pointed to by an content path. The path must exist in
          the previous version of the OCFL Object, and the content cannot have existed in any earlier
          versions of the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Renaming: Changes the file path of existing content. The path cannot exist in the previous
          version of the OCFL Object, and the content cannot have existed in any earlier versions of
          the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deletion: Removes a file path and corresponding content from the current version of an OCFL
          Object. The path and content remain available in earlier versions of the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reinstatement: Makes content from a version earlier than the previous version available in
          the current version of an OCFL Object. The content must exist in an earlier version, and
          not the previous version. The file path may exist in the previous version, effectively updating
          the file path with older content, or it may not, effectively adding the older content as a new
          file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Purging: Purging, as distinct from deletion, covers the complete removal of a file path and
          corresponding content from all versions of an OCFL Object. This is a special case that is
          not supported as part of regular OCFL versioning operations. An approach to implementing this
          is covered in a later section.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Versioning</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Version Numbering</h2>
        <p>
          Version numbering should start with 1 and be positive sequential integers. Names start with a lower case
          <code>v</code>. The numbers may be zero padded to the left to give fixed length, but, if used, zero padded
          numbers must always retain at least one leftmost zero. All versions in an object must use the same version
          numbering layout which can be easily determined by looking at one existing version &#x2014; if the digit
          following <code>v</code> is a zero then the number format is zero padded to fixed length, otherwise it
          is simply an integer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Systems with version directories have often used zero padding in order to show version order with common
          lexical sorting tools (such as Unix <code>ls</code>). Zero padding is not recommended in order to avoid
          having to make arbitrary choices of padding length or to place limits on the number of versions supported.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="version-immutability">
        <h2>Version Immutability</h2>
        <p>
          Previous versions of an object should be considered immutable since the composition of later versions of an
          object may be dependent on them. In addition, the assumption of immutability ensures that copies of different
          versions of an object remain consistent with each other, avoiding issues with identifying canonicity and
          reconciliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          One key consequence of this immutabilty is that manifest entries should never be deleted. New entries may be
          created, and, if not deduplicating file content, additional references to copies of stored content may be
          added.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>File Purging</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes a file needs to be deleted from all versions of an object, perhaps for legal reasons. Doing this to
        an OCFL Object breaks the previous version immutability assumption and is not supported directly. The correct
        way to do this is to create a new object that excludes the offending file, with a revised version history taking
        this into account. The original object can then be deleted in its entirety. Creating the new object first is
        good practice as it avoids any risk of data loss that may occur if an object were to be deleted before the new
        object is created.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new object need not have the same identifier as the original object. In this case, the deleted object may be
        replaced by a placeholder object using the original identifier and location in the OCFL Storage Root. This
        is a standard OCFL object with content that redirects users and software to the new version - possibly with an
        indication of why the new object was created, if appropriate. The OCFL does not define redirect mechanisms,
        the interpretation of object contents is purely a client application concern.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="digest-migration">
      <h2>Migrating to a New Digest Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        Over time new digest algorithms are developed to increase security and address vulnerabilities in existing
        algorithms. It may become desirable to migrate an object to use a new algorithm while retaining
        <a href="#version-immutability">Version Immutability</a>. OCFL supports this through the creation of a new
        version with a new <code>digestAlgorithm</code> that either retains the same object content or is combined with
        a content update.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider an example OCFL object where the <code>digestAlgorithm</code> in the <code>inventory.json</code> is
        <code>sha256</code> and the OCFL object contains a single file (<code>file.txt</code>). We will illustrate
        migration to use <code>sha512</code> without changing the object content. The starting <code>v1</code> file
        layout is:
      </p>
      <pre>
[object root]
    ├── 0=ocfl_object_1.1
    ├── inventory.json
    ├── inventory.json.sha256
    └── v1

        ├── inventory.json.sha256
        └── content
            └── file.txt
      </pre>
      <p>
        and the corresponding inventory is:
      </p>
      <pre>
{
  "digestAlgorithm": "sha256",
  "head": "v1",
  "id": "http://example.org/digest_update_example",
  "manifest": {
    "579391...bfe": [

  }
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        We create a new version, <code>v2</code>, using the <code>digestAlgorithm</code> <code>sha512</code>. The
        <code>v1</code> directory and inventory are unchanged. The <code>v2</code> directory has no <code>content</code>
        directory because no new content is added. The new inventory uses <code>sha512</code> values for the
        <code>manifest</code> and <code>state</code> blocks, the legacy <code>sha256</code> digests are retained
        in the <code>fixity</code> block as an implementation choice. The file layout of the object with
        <code>v2</code> is:

    <section>
      <h2>Log Information</h2>
      <p>
        There may be the need to record some actions on objects that do not result in changes to the object content.
        For example, copying the object to new storage or validating fixity and finding nothing amiss. The
        <code>log</code> directory is the location in an OCFL object where such events can be recorded. The OCFL does
        not make any assumptions about the contents of this directory but, if it exists, then its contents will not be
        subject any validation processes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Forward Delta</h2>
      <p>
        Forward delta differencing is a key, though optional, feature of the OCFL that means that parts of an OCFL
        object version that are unchanged from a previous version are not stored again. This has the potential to
        significantly improve storage efficiency when objects have multiple versions, whether through ongoing
        curatorial action or the accessioning of updated material.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a new version of an OCFL Object is created from an earlier version and a client wishes to implement forward
        delta differencing, then the possible file operations are handled in the following manner (with reference to the
        state and manifest blocks of the OCFL object's inventory file):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inheritance: Files inherited from the previous version unchanged are referenced in the
          <code>state</code> block of the new version. These entries will be identical to the corresponding
          entries in the previous version's <code>state</code> block. No changes to the <code>manifest</code>
          block are required. When a new OCFL version of an OCFL Object is created, the starting point against
          which changes are made should be to copy the entire <code>state</code> block of the previous version,
          thus inheriting all the files and content from the previous version.
        </li>
        <li>
          Addition: Newly added files appear as new entries in the <code>state</code> block of the new version.
          The file should be stored and an entry for the new content must be made in the <code>manifest</code>
          block of the object's inventory. The new digest from the <code>manifest</code> block can then be used
          to create the new <code>state</code> block entry. If the file content, as determined by its digest,
          corresponds to an existing <code>manifest</code> entry then, technically, this is a reinstatement
          operation rather than addition and should be flagged to prevent the operation being recorded incorrectly
          in preservation logs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Updating: Files updated from the previous version appear as changed entries in the <code>state</code>
          block of the new version - with new digests associated with content paths. The updated file should
          be stored and a new entry for the updated content must be made in the <code>manifest</code> block of the
          object's inventory. The new digest can then be used to replace the digest for the old content in
          the relevant <code>state</code> block entry. If the file content, as determined by its digest, corresponds
          to an existing <code>manifest</code> entry then, technically, this is a reinstatement operation rather
          than updating and should be flagged to prevent the operation being recorded incorrectly in preservation
          logs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Renaming: Files renamed from the previous version appear as changed entries in the <code>state</code>
          block of the new version - with existing digests associated with new file paths. No changes to the
          <code>manifest</code> block are required.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deletion: Files deleted from the previous version are simply removed from the <code>state</code>
          block of the new version.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reinstatement: Since reinstated content already exists in earlier versions of the OCFL Object,
          no changes to the <code>manifest</code> block are required. Reinstated entries in the <code>state</code>
          block should replace any entries with the same path inherited from the previous version. If the file
          paths are unchanged then these entries will be identical to the corresponding entries in the earlier
          version's <code>state</code> block.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>An Example Approach to Updating OCFL Object Versions</h2>
      <p>
      The OCFL is designed to be a specification that covers objects at rest and consequently
      does not specify in detail update and file locking mechanisms since these are implementation
      dependent features. Nevertheless, this section includes a simple example of a way to
      update OCFL Objects in a manner that tries to ensure that updates are as transactional as
      possible, and that failures are detectable and recoverable. Objects that are being updated are,
      of course, not expected to be valid OCFL objects until the update operation is completed. Creating
      a new OCFL Object only differs from updating in that it involves creating a version directory
      before version update logic takes over.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Segregating Objects-in-flight</h2>
        <p>
        While an OCFL Object is being created or updated, the files and folders being written should
        be assembled in a location that is ignored by OCFL parsers and validators. When an OCFL Version
        is transferred to the OCFL Object Root, the top level inventory should be updated as the
        final operation. This ensures that all the files referenced by the inventory are valid and,
        consequently, read-only clients that reference the inventory should continue to operate normally
        except for the brief moment when the inventory is actually being updated. In practice, it is
        expected that upstream caching should be able to cover this momentary unavailability in
        the majority of cases. This example approach defines the following:
  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Workspace: Any OCFL Client should have a place to assemble versions before they are transferred
          to the Storage Root to make the transfer operation easier to implement in a controllable
          and recoverable manner. Ideally it should be within the same filesystem/namespace to make file
          transfers as atomic as possible, comprising filesystem metadata changes rather than file copy
          operations. The Workspace is a directory that contains all such objects-in-flight in a similar
          layout to an OCFL Storage Root.
          </li>
          <li>
          Object Workspace Directory: In this example, for simplicity, each OCFL Object being created or
          updated has a path in the Workspace that is the same as its eventual storage path in the OCFL
          Storage Root. This means that it is easy for clients to determine if an object is being updated
          and also provides a mechanism to implement objects with mutable current versions without
          violating OCFL assumptions. When updating an OCFL Object, it is useful to make a copy of the
          inventory of most recent stable version of the object in this directory when it is created
          at the start of the update operation.
          </li>
          <li>
          Version Assembly Directory: In this case, one version assembly directory should exist per OCFL
          Object at any time and updates to it should be managed by a single controlling process to avoid
          conflicts. If updates to multiple objects, or from multiple sources, need to be supported, then
          it should be implemented upstream of version assembly in order to allow additional locking and
          conflict resolution. It is useful to have a unique transaction identifier for each object being
          updated to simplify any overlying process control logic (For example, it could be used as an
          eTag for a REST API implementation). This transaction identifier can be used to generate a name
          for the version assembly directory, which sits within the object workspace directory.
          </li>
          <li>
          Temporary Inventory Files: A top level object inventory file should never be updated in situ.
          Instead, a new inventory should be created in a version assembly directory and updated as
          the version contents are modified. This provides some level of forensic recovery information in
          the event of failure during version creation. When the construction of the new version
          and its inventory is complete, it can then be copied to a temporary file name alongside
          the top level inventory. In this case, temporary inventory files always occur in OCFL Object
          Roots and are named <code>tmp_inventory.json</code>, for argument's sake. The presence of this
          file is not valid OCFL and indicative of an update failure.

      Bearing in mind the definitions specified above, it is possible to sketch out how
      they can be used to ensure some level of integrity during OCFL updates.

            </li>
            <li>
            Create a version assembly directory and save the transaction ID - in this case, using it as

            Generate inventory checksum file in version assembly directory. This effectively locks and

            Move/rename version assembly directory to valid OCFL version directory name in OCFL Object
            Root in the OCFL Storage Root. At this point all of the new version content is in place in
            the OCFL Object but the top level inventory still references the previous version. This is
            assumed to be an atomic operation. Otherwise, copy the version assembly directory, keeping
            its name then rename to a valid version directory.

            Update the inventory by deleting the old one and renaming the temporary one. This should
            not take very long and is the only time when read-only clients cannot access the object

          <ol>
            <li>
            Delete version assembly directories and temporary inventory files - this automatically reverts
            objects to last known good version. Assembly directories anywhere in an OCFL Storage Root are
            a result of failed copies.
            </li>
            <li>
            If the inventory checksum fails then the inventory is corrupted by a failed copy. This should be
            recoverable from the most recent version directory (which is the newly created one).
            </li>
            <li>
            Any overlying transactional store will need cleanup but basically repeat 5-9 above after validating
            all object checksums - considering some sort of failure has just occurred.
