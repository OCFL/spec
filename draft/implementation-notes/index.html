    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This document provides guidance to OCFL implementers for how clients should behave when operating on
        OCFL Objects.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Rebuildability</h2>
    <p>
      A key goal of OCFL is the rebuildability of a repository from an OCFL storage root without additional information
      resources. Consequently, a key implementation consideration should be to ensure that OCFL objects contain all the
      data and metadata required to achieve this. With reference to the [[OAIS]] model, this would include all the
      descriptive, administrative, structural, representation, and preservation metadata relevant to the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, as an aid to those who may need to recover OCFL objects in the future, it is recommended that a
      copy of the [[OCFL-Spec]] is stored in the top level of the OCFL storage root. OCFL ignores files other than the
      conformance declaration at the top level so it is a good location to store documentation that may be useful for
      recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more complete approach would be to create a specific OCFL object that contains this documentation and to have a
      pointer to its location in the storage root. This documentation object would then be subject OCFL validation and
      any other digital preservation processes that might be implemented without requiring special handling.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Filesystem metadata</h2>
    <p>
      Filesystem metadata (e.g. permissions, access, and creation times) are not considered portable between filesystems
      or preservable through file transfer operations. Nor can these attributes be validated in terms of fixity in a
      consistent manner. As such, OCFL neither explicitly supports nor expects that these quanties remain consistent.
      If retaining this metadata is important then files should either be encapsulated in a filesystem image format that
      preserves this information, or the metadata extracted and stored explicitly in an additional file.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Empty Directories</h2>
    <p>
      OCFL preserves files and their content, with directories serving as a useful organizational convention. An empty
      directory consists only of filesystem metadata and therefore, as noted above, is not amenable to direct
      preservation in OCFL. If the preservation of empty directories is considered essential then the suggested route
      is to insert a zero length file named <code>.keep</code> into the directory which will ensure directories are
      preserved as part of the file's path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <code>.keep</code> files are not considered special by OCFL in any way and are treated exactly the same
      way as other files. As such, a non-zero length <code>.keep</code> file is not considered invalid.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data and Metadata</h2>
    <p>
      OCFL object versions are composed of series of files/bitstreams but OCFL does not make any disctinction between
      different types of files other than those reserved for OCFL functionality: the inventory, its digest file, and
      conformance declaration files. It is possible, for example, to create separate data and metadata directories
      within each version to help organize material but all files are treated equally for the purpose of OCFL
      validation and management.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>
      OCFL separates the existing file path of stored files from the logical file path of these files' content in OCFL
      object versions. This is a key feature that allows previous versions of objects to remain immutable but
      permitting deduplication, forward delta differencing, and easy file renaming. Consequently, OCFL only requires
      that files added to any version of an OCFL object must be stored somewhere within the relevant version
      directory, with a corresponding entry in the manifest block. An entry in the state block determines the path
      and name of the file within that version by referencing the manifest entry, not the actual path on disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most transparent approach is to have the path used to store the file on disk the same as the path of the
      file within the object when accessioned. This is readily understandable in terms of visual inspection of the
      physical filesystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is not always possible. For example, complex objects with deep file hierarchies may encounter
      issues if they come from a fileystem that allows longer paths than are supported by the target OCFL system. In
      this case, the decoupling between existing file paths and logical file paths in OCFL allows the use of truncated
      paths for storage while the full paths can be preserved in state block entries which are not length constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another use case is importing content from other repository systems which renames files on ingest and stores
      them in a flat hierarchy. These can be imported, as is, and the original paths and file names recorded through
      suitable state block entries rather than reconstructing a physical file layout. Of course, OCFL supports
      ongoing use of such a methodology.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <h2>Storage Root Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>
          Strictly speaking, OCFL only requires that an OCFL Storage Root contains OCFL Objects in zip files
          or directories, distributed in some manner in the underlying filesystem. In turn, an OCFL object is
          identified purely by the presence of a [[NAMASTE]] conformance file in the object root. The presence
          and correctness of inventory files and version directories are a validation rather than an
          identification concern.
      </p>
      <p>
          These definitions allow a lot of freedom as to how objects are arranged beneath an OCFL Storage
          Root and, while there is no strict requirement for all OCFL Objects to be arranged according the same
          system it is nevertheless considered good practice to do so. In addition, in the interests of
          rebuildability, it would be prudent to include an indication of the details of this arrangement
          alongside the OCFL specification as described in the Rebuildability section.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the interests of transparency the it makes sense for an object's URI, its unique identifier and
          its location under the OCFL Storage Root to be aligned and simply derivable from each other. Good
          examples include:
      </p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  Flat: Each object is contained in a directory or zip file that is simply named for the
                  unique identifer of the object, possibly with escaping of characters that are not
                  permitted in file/directory names. While this is a very simple approach, most filesystems begin
                  to encounter performance issues when directories contain more than a few thousand files so
                  this arrangement is best suited to repositories with a small number of objects (or many
                  OCFL Storage Roots).

                  PairTree: [[!Pairtree]] is designed to overcome the limitations on the number of files in a
                  directory that most file systems have. It creates hierarchy of directories by mapping identifier
                  strings to directory paths two characters at a time. For numerical identifiers specified in
                  hexadecimal this means that there are a maximum of 256 items in any directory which is well
                  within the capacity of any modern filesystem. However, for long identifiers, pairtree creates
                  a large number of directories which will be sparsely populated unless the number of objects
                  is very large. Traversing all these directories during validation or rebuilding operations can
                  be slow.

                  Truncated n-tuple Tree: This approach aims to achieve some of the scalability benefits of
                  PairTree whilst limiting the depth of the resulting directory hierarchy. To achieve this,
                  the source identifier can be split at a higher level of granularity, and only a limited
                  number of the identifier digits are used to generate directory paths. For example, using
                  triples and three levels with example above yields:

    <h2>Basic File Operations</h2>
    <p>
        OCFL and its inventory structure are designed to support and capture the following file operations
        that create OCFL versions, regardless of whether optional features, such as deduplication, are used.
        OCFL is not concerned with the process of creating versions but only the final outcome in terms of
        the differences with the previous version that need to be recorded and preserved.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Inheritance: By default a new version of an OCFL Object inherits all the filenames and file
                content from the previous version. This serves as the basis against which changes are applied
                to create a new version. A newly created OCFL Object, obviously, inherits no content and is
                populated by file additions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Addition: Adds a new file path and corresponding content to an OCFL Object. The path cannot
                exist in the previous version of the object, and the content cannot have existed in any
                earlier versions of the object.
            </li>
            <li>
                Updating: Changes the content pointed to by an exsting file path. The path must exist in
                the previous version of the OCFL Object, and the content cannot have existed in any earlier
                versions of the object.
            </li>
            <li>
                Renaming: Changes the file path of existing content. The path cannot exist in the previous
                version of the OCFL Object, and the content cannot have existed in any earlier versions of
                the bject.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deletion: Removes a file path and corresponding content from the current version of an OCFL
                Object. The path and content remain available in earlier versions of the object.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reinstatement: Makes content from a version earlier than the previous version available in
                the current version of an OCFL Object. The content must exist in an earlier version, and
                not the previous version. The file path may exist in the previous version, effectively updating
                the file path with older content, or it may not, effectively adding the older content as a new
                file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Purging: Purging, as distinct from deletion, covers the complete removal of a file path and
                corresponding content from all versions of an OCFL Object. This is a special case that is
                not supported as part of regular OCFL versioning operations. An approach to implementing this
                is covered in a later section.
            </li>
        </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Version Immutability</h2>
    <p>
      Previous versions of an object should be considered immutable since the composition of later versions of an
      object may be dependent on them. In addition, the assumtion of immutability ensures that copies of different
      versions of an object remain cosistent with each other, avoiding issues with identifying canonicity and
      reconcilitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One key consequence of this immutabilty is that manifest entries should never be deleted. New entries may be
      created, and, if not deduplicating file content, additional references to copies of stored content may be added.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Deduplication</h2>
    <p>
      OCFL supports optional deduplication if a client ensures that all digests in the manifest block refer to a
      single file path on disk. This entry is created the first time file content is stored in an OCFL Object.
      Subsequent references to that file content should then occur in the state block only. This can be determined by
      computing the digests of incoming files and determining if they already exist in the manifest block.
    </p>
    <p>
      If deduplication is carried out within an object then, for consistency, it is expected that Forward Delta
      differencing will also be used between object versions so subsequent references to duplicated content should
      also refer back to the original manifest entry rather than updating it to include additional references.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Forward Delta</h2>
    <p>
      Forward delta differencing is a key, though optional, feature of OCFL that means that parts of an OCFL object
      version that are unchanged from a previous version are not stored again. This has the potential to signficantly
      improve storage efficiency when objects have multiple versions, whether through ongoing curatorial action or
      the accessioning of updated material.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a new version of an OCFL Object is created from an earlier version and a client wishes to implement forward
      delta differencing, then the possible file operations are handled in the following manner (with reference to the
      state and manifest blocks of the OCFL object's inventory file):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inheritance: Files inherited from the previous version unchanged are referenced in the
            <code>state</code> block of the new version. These entries will be identical to the corresponding
            entries in the previous version's <code>state</code> block. No changes to the <code>manifest</code>
            block are required. When a new OCFL version of an OCFL Object is created, the starting point against
            which changes are made should be to copy the entire <code>state</code> block of the previous version,
            thus inheriting all the files and content from the previous version.
        </li>
        <li>
            Addition: Newly added files appear as new entries in the <code>state</code> block of the new version.
            The file should be stored and an entry for the new content must be made in the <code>manifest</code>
            block of the object's inventory. The new digest from the <code>manifest</code> block can then be used
            to create the new <code>state</code> block entry. If the file content, as determined by its digest,
            corresponds to an existing <code>manifest</code> entry then, technically, this is a reinstatement
            operation rather than addition and should be flagged to prevent the operation being recorded incorrectly
            in preservation logs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Updating: Files updated from the previous version appear as changed entries in the <code>state</code>
            block of the new version - with new digests associated with existing file paths. The updated file should
            be stored and a new entry for the updated content must be made in the <code>manifest</code> block of the
            object's inventory. The new digest can then be used to replace the digest for the old content in
            the relevant <code>state</code> block entry. If the file content, as determined by its digest, corresponds
            to an existing <code>manifest</code> entry then, technically, this is a reinstatement operation rather
            than updating and should be flagged to prevent the operation being recorded incorrectly in preservation
            logs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Renaming: Files renamed from the previous version appear as changed entries in the <code>state</code>
            block of the new version - with existing digests associated with new file paths. No changes to the
            <code>manifest</code> block are required.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deletion: Files deleted from the previous version are simply removed from the <code>state</code>
            block of the new version.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reinstatement: Since reinstated content already exists in earlier versions of the OCFL Object,
            no changes to the <code>manifest</code> block are required. Reinstated entries in the <code>state</code>
            block should replace any entries with the same path inherited from the previous version. If the file
            paths are unchanged then these entries will be identical to the corresponding entries in the earlier
            version's <code>state</code> block.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Fixity</h2>
    <p>
      The digests in the manifest are used by OCFL for content addressability rather than fixity but they are
      suitable for use as part of a fixity regime, and the manifest block usefully identifies all the files in an
      object. OCFL validation also requires that digests and files match. However, while the characteristics of digest
      algorithms that make them suitable for fixity checking and content addressing are closely related, they are not
      identical. In particular, fixity against malicious tampering requires that a digest computation is hard to
      reverse, which is not a requirement for content addressing. It is this aspect which is the most frequent target
      for cryptoanalytic attack.

      Consequently, it is sensible to allow additional or alternative fixity algorithms to be used. These may be made
      in a <a href="../spec/#fixity">fixity block</a> which has the same layout as a manifest block but permits a
      broader range of algorithms. OCFL will consider a fixity block valid if all the files referenced in the block
      exist but OCFL does not validate digests for all possible algorithms. The fixity block does not have to include
      all the files in an object to permit legacy fixity to be imported without requiring continued use of obsolete
      digest algorithms.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>File Purging</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes a file needs to be deleted from all versons of an object, perhaps for legal reasons. Doing this to
      an OCFL Object breaks the previous version immutability assumption and is not supported directly. The correct
      way to do this is to create a new object that excludes the offending file, with a revised version history taking
      this into account. The original object can then be deleted in its entirety. Creating the new object first is
      good practice as it avoids any risk of data loss that may occur if an object were to be deleted before the new
      object is created. The new object may not have the same identifier as the original object so the deleted object
      can be replaced by a "stub" object that redirects users and software to the new version. A "stub" object is just
      a standard OCFL Object - its structure, interpretation and handling are client dependent.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Log Information</h2>
    <p>
      There may be the need to record some actions on objects that do not result in changes to the object content.
      For example, copying the object to new storage or validating fixity and finding nothing amiss. The
      <code>log</code> directory is the location in an OCFL object where such events can be recorded. OCFL does not
      make any assumptions about the contents of this directory but, if it exists, then its contents will not be
      subject any validation processes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Version Numbering</h2>
    <p>
      Version numbering should start with 1 and be positive sequential integers. Names start with a lower case
      <code>v</code>. The numbers may be zero padded to the left to give fixed length, but, if used, zero padded
      numbers must always retain at least one leftmost zero. All versions in an object must use the same version
      numbering layout which can be easily determined by looking at one existing version &#x2014; if the digit
      following <code>v</code> is a zero then the number format is zero padded to fixed length, otherwise it
      is simply an integer.
