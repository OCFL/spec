  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
      This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent approach to the storage
      of digital objects in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term
      access and management of digital objects within digital repositories.
  </p>
  <p>
      This specification is a normative specification which describes the nature of an OCFL Object (the
      "object-at-rest"). A set of recommendations for how OCFL Objects should be acted upon (the "object-in-motion")
      can be found in the [[OCFL-Implementation-Notes]].
  </p>
    <section id="need">
        <h2>Need</h2>
        <p>
           The OCFL initiative arose from a need to have well-defined application-independent file management within
           digital repositories.
        </p>
        <p>
           A general observation is that the contents of a digital repository -- that is, the digital files and metadata
           that an institution might wish to manage -- are largely stable. Once content has been accessioned, it is
           unlikely to change significantly over its lifetime. This is in contrast to the software applications that
           manage these contents, which are ephemeral, requiring constant updating and replacement. Thus, transitions
           between application-specific methods of file management to support software upgrades and replacement cycles
           can be seen as unnecessary and risky change which affects the long-term stable objects in support of the
           short-term, ephemeral software.
        </p>
        <p>
           By providing a specification for the file and directory layout on disk, OCFL is an attempt at reducing, or
           even eliminating, the need for these transitions. As an application-independent specification, conforming
           applications will natively "understand" the underlying file structure without needing to first transition
           these contents to their own format.

<section id="object-spec">
    <h2>OCFL Object</h2>
    <p>
        An OCFL Object is a group of one or more content files and administrative information, that are together
        identified by a URI. The object may contain a sequence of versions of the files that represent the evolution
        of the object's contents.
    </p>
    <p>
        A file is defined as a content bitstream that can be stored and transmitted. Directories (also called "folders")
        allow for the organization of files into tree-like hierarchies. The content of an OCFL Object is the files and
        the directories they are organized in that are stored <i>within</i> the hierarchy layout described in this
        specification.
    </p>
    <p>
        An OCFL Object includes administrative information that identifies a directory as an OCFL Object, and also
        provides a means of tracking changes to the contents of the object over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        An OCFL Object is therefore:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A conceptual gathering of all files (data and metadata), the directories they are organized in, and their
            changes over time which together form the digital representation of an entity that need to be managed, in
            preservation terms, as a single coherent whole (i.e., content); and</li>
        <li>A file and directory layout and administrative information on a storage medium that provides a defined
            structure for the storage of this content, and through which these files and their changes may be understood
            (i.e., structure).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        A key goal of OCFL is the rebuildability of a repository from an OCFL Storage Root without additional
        information resources. Consequently, a key implementation consideration should be to ensure that OCFL Objects
        contain all the data and metadata required to achieve this. With reference to the [[OAIS]] model, this would
        include all the descriptive, administrative, structural, representation and preservation metadata relevant
        to the object.
    </p>
    <p>
        A central feature of the OCFL specification is support for versioning. This recognizes that digital objects will
        change over time, through new requirements, fixes, updates, or format shifts. The specification takes no
        position on what constitutes a version or a versionable action, but it is recommended that implementers have a
        clear position on this within their local storage policies.
    </p>

    <section id="object-structure">
        <h2>Object Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The basic OCFL Object structure has a minimal set of files and directories necessary to support content
            storage and object validation. The minimum required is shown in the following figure:
        </p>
        <pre>
[object_root]
    ├── 0=ocfl_object_1.0
    ├── inventory.json
    ├── inventory.json.sha512
    └── v1
        ├── inventory.json
        └── inventory.json.sha512
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="object-conformance-declaration">
        <h2>Object Conformance Declaration</h2>
        <p>
            The version declaration MUST be formatted according to the [[!NAMASTE]] specification. It MUST be an empty
            file in the base directory of the object giving the OCFL Object version in the filename. The filename MUST
            be constructed with a leading zero-equals (<code>0=</code>) string, the string <code>ocfl_object_</code>,
            followed by the OCFL specification version number. For example <code>0=ocfl_object_1.0</code> for version
            1.0 of this specification.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="version-directories">
        <h2>Version Directories</h2>
        <p>
            OCFL Object content is stored as a sequence of one or more versions. Each object version is stored in a
            version directory under the object root. The sequence of version numbers is the sequence of positive
            integers: 1, 2, 3, etc., and the version directory name is constructed by adding the prefix <code>v</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implementations SHOULD use version directory names constructed without zero-padding the
            version number, ie. <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>, <code>v3</code>, etc..
        </p>
        <p>
            For compatibility with existing filesystem conventions, implementations MAY use zero-padded version
            directory numbers, with the following restriction: If zero-padded version directory numbers are used then
            they MUST start with the prefix <code>v</code> and then a zero. For example, in an implementation that uses
            five digits for version directory names then <code>v00001</code> to <code>v09999</code> are allowed,
            <code>v10000</code> is not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first version of an object defines the naming convention for all version directories for the object.
            All version directories of an object MUST use the same naming convention: either a non-padded version
            directory number, or a zero-padded version directory number of consistent length. Operations that add a new
            version to an object MUST follow the version directory naming convention established by earlier versions.
            In all cases, references to files inside version directories from inventory files MUST use the actual
            version directory names.

        <h2>Digests</h2>
        <p>
            Digests play two roles in an OCFL Object. The first is that digests allow for content-addressable
            storage; that is, for a file to be addressed by the digest of its contents, rather than its filename.
            The second is that digests provide for fixity checks to determine whether a file has become corrupt
            through hardware degradation, accident, or malicious actors.
        </p>
        <p>
            OCFL Objects SHOULD use <code>sha512</code> by default. The choice of <code>sha512</code> recognizes
            that it has no known collision vulnerabilities and is less computationally intensive to compute than
            <code>sha256</code>, [[Stop-Using-SHA-256]].
        </p>
        <p>
            For content addressability OCFL Objects MUST use either <code>sha256</code> or <code>sha512</code>, to
            reduce the likelihood of digest collisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, for legacy content migration and consistency, implementers MAY choose from the following
            list of digest algorithms for storing fixity values:

                    For example, the <code>sha1</code> digest of a zero-length bitstream is

            An OCFL Inventory MAY contain a fixity section that can store one or more blocks containing fixity values
            using multiple digest algorithms. See the <a href="#fixity">section on fixity</a> below for further details.

                Non-normative note: Implementers may also store copies of their file digests in a system external to

            <p>
                Implementers should be aware that base16 digests are case insensitive. Different tools will generate
                digests in uppercase or lowercase, and this may lead to case differences between references to a digest
                and the digest itself within the inventory. If string-based methods are used to work with digests
                and inventories (as is the case in most common JSON libraries) then extra care must be taken to ensure
                case-insensitive comparisons are being made.

            this for storing files that contain a record of actions taken on the object. Since these logs may be subject
            to local standards requirements, the format of these logs is considered out-of-scope for the OCFL Object.
            Clients operating on the object MAY log actions here that are not otherwise captured.

                As an example, implementers may have different local requirements to store audit information for their

                wrong, while others may wish to only store a log entry if an intervention was required.

    <p>
      An <a>OCFL Storage Root</a> is the base directory of an OCFL storage layout.
    </p>

    <section id="root-structure">
        <h2>Root Structure</h2>
        <p>
          An OCFL Storage Root MUST contain a
          <a href="#root-conformance-declaration">Root Conformance Declaration</a> identifying it as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          An OCFL Storage Root SHOULD also contain the OCFL specification in human-readable plain-text format
          in the root.
        </p>
        <p>
          An OCFL Storage Root MUST NOT contain any files or directories other than those described here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although implementations may require multiple OCFL Storage Roots; that is, several logical or
          physical volumes, or multiple "buckets" in an object store, each OCFL Storage Root MUST be independent.
          For example, an institution may have a "newspapers" project that standardizes on OCFL 1.0, but then may have
          a later "letters" project that wishes to use OCFL 1.2. These two projects would exist within two separate
          OCFL Storage Roots.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example OCFL Storage Root represents the minimal set of files and folders:
        </p>

    <section id="root-conformance-declaration">
        <h2>Root Conformance Declaration</h2>
        <p>
          The OCFL version declaration MUST be formatted according to the [[!NAMASTE]] specification. It MUST be an
          empty file in the base directory of the <a>OCFL Storage Root</a> giving the OCFL version in the filename.
          The filename MUST be constructed with a leading zero-equals (<code>0=</code>) string, the string
          <code>ocfl_</code>, followed by the OCFL specification version number. For example <code>0=ocfl_1.0</code>
          for version 1.0 of this specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Root conformance indicates that the OCFL Storage Root conforms to this section (i.e. the OCFL Storage Root
          section) of the specification.  OCFL Objects within the OCFL Storage Root also include a conformance
          declaration which MUST indicate OCFL Object conformance to the same or earlier version of the specification.

          A common practice is to use a unique identifier scheme to compose this storage hierarchy, typically arranged

          <li>Storage hierarchies within the same OCFL Storage Root SHOULD consistently use either a directory

            [[BagIt]] is a common file packaging specification, but unlike OCFL it does not provide a mechanism for
            content versioning. Using OCFL it is possible to store a BagIt structure with content versioning, such
            that when the object state is resolved, it creates a valid BagIt 'bag'. This example will illustrate how
            this can be accomplished, using the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-17#section-4.1">

        <h2>Moab in an OCFL Object</h2>
        <p>
            [[Moab]] is an archive information package format developed and used by Stanford University.
            Many of the ideas in Moab have been refined by OCFL, and OCFL is designed to
            give institutions currently using Moab an easy path to adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Converting content preserved in a Moab object in a way that does not compromise existing Moab
            access patterns whilst allowing for the eventual use of OCFL-native workflows requires a Moab to
            OCFL conversion tool. This tool uses the Moab-versioning gem to extract deltas and digests
            of the Moab data directory for each Moab version and translate those into version state blocks
            in an OCFL inventory file, which would be placed in the root directory of the Moab object.
            All extant files in the Moab version directories are tracked in the manifest block. The contents
            of the Moab manifests directory are not tracked in the version state blocks; they are effectively
            deleted from the OCFL object without compromising legacy access patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the transitionary period the OCFL inventory file exists only in the root of the Moab object.
            Once OCFL-native object creation workflows have been completed, future versions of that object will
            be fully OCFL compliant - new versions will no longer have a manifests directory and will contain an
            OCFL inventory file. At this stage OCFL tools will be able to access all versions of the content
            originally preserved by Moab.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the following sample Moab object:
