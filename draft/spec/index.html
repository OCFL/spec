  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
      This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent approach to the storage
      of digital objects in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term
      access and management of digital objects within digital repositories.
  </p>
  <p>
      This normative specification describes the nature of an OCFL Object (the "object-at-rest") and the arrangement
      of OCFL Objects under an OCFL Storage Root. A set of recommendations for how OCFL Objects should be acted upon
      (the "object-in-motion") can be found in the [[OCFL-Implementation-Notes]]. The OCFL editorial group recommends
      reading both the specification and the implementation notes in order to understand the full scope of the OCFL.
  </p>
    <section id="need">
        <h2>Need</h2>
        <p>
          The OCFL initiative arose from a need to have well-defined application-independent file management within
          digital repositories.
        </p>
        <p>
          A general observation is that the contents of a digital repository &#8212; that is, the digital files and
          metadata that an institution might wish to manage &#8212; are largely stable. Once content has been
          accessioned, it is unlikely to change significantly over its lifetime. This is in contrast to the software
          applications that manage these contents, which are ephemeral, requiring constant updating and replacement.
          Thus, transitions between application-specific methods of file management to support software upgrades and
          replacement cycles can be seen as unnecessary and risky change which affects the long-term stable objects
          in support of the short-term, ephemeral software.
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing a specification for the file and directory layout on disk or in an object store, the OCFL is an
          attempt at reducing, or even eliminating, the need for these transitions. As an application-independent
          specification, conforming applications will natively "understand" the underlying file structure without
          needing to first transition these contents to their own format.
         </p>
        <p>
          While digital repository content changes relatively slowly, it is necessary to be able to track changes to
          digital objects. Within the file and directory layout specification, the OCFL provides a simple structure to
          efficiently capture versions of object contents so that all previous states of an object may be recovered
          and examined.

<section id="object-spec">
    <h2>OCFL Object</h2>
    <p>
        An OCFL Object is a group of one or more content files and administrative information, that are together
        identified by a URI. The object may contain a sequence of versions of the files that represent the evolution
        of the object's contents.
    </p>
    <p>
        A file is defined as a content bitstream that can be stored and transmitted. Directories (also called "folders")
        allow for the organization of files into tree-like hierarchies. The content of an OCFL Object is the files and
        the directories they are organized in that are stored <i>within</i> the hierarchy layout described in this
        specification.
    </p>
    <p>
        An OCFL Object includes administrative information that identifies a directory as an OCFL Object, and also
        provides a means of tracking changes to the contents of the object over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        An OCFL Object is therefore:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A conceptual gathering of all files (data and metadata), the directories they are organized in, and their
            changes over time which together form the digital representation of an entity that need to be managed, in
            preservation terms, as a single coherent whole (i.e., content); and</li>
        <li>A file and directory layout and administrative information on a storage medium that provides a defined
            structure for the storage of this content, and through which these files and their changes may be understood
            (i.e., structure).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        A key goal of the OCFL is the rebuildability of a repository from an OCFL Storage Root without additional
        information resources. Consequently, a key implementation consideration should be to ensure that OCFL Objects
        contain all the data and metadata required to achieve this. With reference to the [[OAIS]] model, this would
        include all the descriptive, administrative, structural, representation and preservation metadata relevant
        to the object.
    </p>
    <p>
        A central feature of the OCFL specification is support for versioning. This recognizes that digital objects will
        change over time, through new requirements, fixes, updates, or format shifts. The specification takes no
        position on what constitutes a version or a versionable action, but it is recommended that implementers have a
        clear position on this within their local storage policies.
    </p>

        <h2>Object Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The OCFL Object structure organizes content files and administrative information in order to support
            content storage and object validation. The structure for an object with one version is shown in the
            following figure:
        </p>

    <section id="object-conformance-declaration">
        <h2>Object Conformance Declaration</h2>
        <p>
            The version declaration MUST be formatted according to the [[!NAMASTE]] specification. It MUST be a
            file in the base directory of the <a>OCFL Object Root</a> giving the OCFL version in the filename.
            The filename MUST conform to the pattern <code>T=dvalue</code>, where <code>T</code> MUST be 0, and
            <code>dvalue</code> MUST be <code>ocfl_object_</code>, followed by the OCFL specification version number.
            The text contents of the file MUST be the same as <code>dvalue</code>, followed by a newline
            (<code>\n</code>).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="version-directories">
        <h2>Version Directories</h2>
        <p>
            OCFL Object content MUST be stored as a sequence of one or more versions. Each object version is stored in a
            version directory under the object root. The sequence of version numbers is the sequence of positive,
            base-ten integers: 1, 2, 3, etc., and the version directory name is constructed by adding the prefix
            <code>v</code>. The version number sequence MUST start at 1 and MUST be continuous without missing integers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implementations SHOULD use version directory names constructed without zero-padding the
            version number, ie. <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>, <code>v3</code>, etc..
        </p>
        <p>
            For compatibility with existing filesystem conventions, implementations MAY use zero-padded version
            directory numbers, with the following restriction: If zero-padded version directory numbers are used then
            they MUST start with the prefix <code>v</code> and then a zero. For example, in an implementation that uses
            five digits for version directory names then <code>v00001</code> to <code>v09999</code> are allowed,
            <code>v10000</code> is not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first version of an object defines the naming convention for all version directories for the object.
            All version directories of an object MUST use the same naming convention: either a non-padded version
            directory number, or a zero-padded version directory number of consistent length. Operations that add a new
            version to an object MUST follow the version directory naming convention established by earlier versions.
            In all cases, references to files inside version directories from inventory files MUST use the actual
            version directory names.
        </p>
        <p>
            Version directories MUST have a sub-directory called <code>content</code> if there are files present, and
            SHOULD NOT contain a <code>content</code> sub-directory otherwise. There MUST be no other files or
            directories as children of a version directory, other than an <a href="#inventory">inventory file</a>,
            an <a href="#inventory-digest">inventory digest</a>, and a <code>content</code> directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every file within a version's <code>content</code> directory MUST be referenced in the
            <a href="#manifest">manifest</a> section of the inventory. There MUST NOT be empty directories within
            a version's <code>content</code> directory. A directory that would otherwise be empty MAY be maintained
            by creating a file within it named according to local conventions, for example by making an empty
            <code>.keep</code> file.

        <h2>Digests</h2>
        <p>
            Digests play two roles in an OCFL Object. The first is that digests allow for content-addressable
            reference to files within the OCFL Object. That is, the connection between a file's <a>content
            path</a> on physical storage and its <a>logical path</a> in a version of the object's content is made
            with a digest of its contents, rather than its filename. This use of the content digest facilitates
            de-duplication of files with the same content within an object, such as files that are unchanged from
            one version to the next. The second role that digests play is provide for fixity checks to determine
            whether a file has become corrupt, through hardware degradation or accident for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            For content-addressing, OCFL Objects SHOULD use <code>sha512</code>. The choice of the <code>sha512</code>
            digest algorithm as default recognizes that it has no known collision vulnerabilities, is less
            computationally intensive to compute than <code>sha256</code>, [[Stop-Using-SHA-256]], and multiple
            implementations are available.
        </p>
        <p>
            For storage of additional fixity values, and perhaps to support legacy content migration, implementers
            MAY choose from the following list of digest algorithms:

                    [[!FIPS-180-4]] and MUST be encoded using hex (base16) encoding [[!RFC4648]].
                    For example, the <code>sha256</code> digest of a zero-length bitstream starts
                    <code>e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4...</code> (64 hex digits long).</td>

            An OCFL Inventory MAY contain a fixity section that can store one or more blocks containing fixity values

                Non-normative note: Implementers may also store copies of their file digests in a system external to

            <p>
                Implementers should be aware that base16 digests are case insensitive. Different tools will generate
                digests in uppercase or lowercase, and this may lead to case differences between references to a digest
                and the digest itself within the inventory. If string-based methods are used to work with digests
                and inventories (as is the case in most common JSON libraries) then extra care must be taken to ensure
                case-insensitive comparisons are being made.

        </p>
        <p>
          An OCFL Storage Root MAY contain other files. These might include a human-readable copy of the OCFL

          An OCFL Storage Root MAY contain a JSON file named <code>ocfl_layout.json</code> to describe the arrangement
          of directories and OCFL objects under the storage root.
          If present, this JSON document MUST include the following two keys in the root JSON object:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>uri</code> - A URI identifying the precise arrangement of directories and OCFL objects under the

            If a URL is used then it SHOULD resolve to a detailed specification of the arrangement.

            An OCFL Storage Root MAY contain a directory named <code>deposit</code>, which MAY be empty. Implementations
            MAY use this directory for assembling new or updated content. Clients performing any other operation, or
            validating a storage root, MUST ignore the <code>deposit</code> directory if present.

        <p>
          Except for a <code>deposit</code> directory, sub-directories within an OCFL Storage Root MUST NOT contain

            The example object has just one version, <code>v1</code>, which has two files with logical paths
            <code>a file.wxy</code> and <code>another file.xyz</code> as shown in the <code>state</code> block.
            The corresponding content paths are <code>v1/content/3bacb119a98a15c5</code> and
            <code>v1/content/9f2bab8ef869947d</code> respectively, as shown in the <code>manifest</code>.
            Except for location within the appropriate version directory, <code>v1/content</code> in this example,
            the OCFL specification does not constrain the choice of content paths used when creating or

            target storage system, or on portability considerations. Any compliant implementation will be able to
            recover version state with the original logical paths.

        <h2>Moab in an OCFL Object</h2>
        <p>
            [[Moab]] is an archive information package format developed and used by Stanford University.
            Many of the ideas in Moab have been refined by the OCFL, and the OCFL is designed to
            give institutions currently using Moab an easy path to adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Converting content preserved in a Moab object in a way that does not compromise existing Moab
            access patterns whilst allowing for the eventual use of OCFL-native workflows requires a Moab to
            OCFL conversion tool. This tool uses the Moab-versioning gem to extract deltas and digests
            of the Moab data directory for each Moab version and translate those into version state blocks
            in an OCFL inventory file, which would be placed in the root directory of the Moab object.
            All extant files in the Moab version directories are tracked in the manifest block. The contents
            of the Moab manifests directory are not tracked in the version state blocks; they are effectively
            deleted from the OCFL object without compromising legacy access patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the transitionary period the OCFL inventory file exists only in the root of the Moab object.
            Once OCFL-native object creation workflows have been completed, future versions of that object will
            be fully OCFL compliant - new versions will no longer have a manifests directory and will contain an
            OCFL inventory file. At this stage OCFL tools will be able to access all versions of the content
            originally preserved by Moab.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the following sample Moab object:
