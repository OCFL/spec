# Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL)

The Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) initiative is motivated by the need for a preservation-centric, common approach to filesystem (or cloud / object storage) layout for digital repositories. The goal of this effort is to establish a specified recommendation for such a layout.

This repositoty is the home of OCFL specification and implementation notes. It is published to https://ocfl.io . Key documents:

  * [This specification repository](https://github.com/OCFL/spec)
    * [Current drafts on github](https://github.com/OCFL/spec/tree/main/draft)
    * v1.1 [specification](https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/) and [implementation notes](https://ocfl.io/1.1/implementation-notes/)
    * v1.0 [specification](https://ocfl.io/1.0/spec/) and [implementation notes](https://ocfl.io/1.0/implementation-notes/)
  * [Meeting notes and wiki](https://github.com/OCFL/spec/wiki)

Documentation in other repositories:

  * [Specification extensions](https://github.com/OCFL/extensions)
  * [Test fixtures](https://github.com/OCFL/fixtures)
  * [Use cases](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases)

Additionally, in support of collaboration and discoverability, we encourage the inclusion of software tooling created by the OCFL community to be minimally linked from the [implementations documentation](https://github.com/OCFL/spec/wiki/Implementations) and potentially hosted in this GitHub organization, as appropriate. 

See [the guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CboNeHVv7DF0HsbLIJoracKAYa40hGV-gofpYK6XIg/edit?usp=sharing) regarding how to create and manage an OCFL-related project (i.e. "contributed project") on this GitHub organization.
