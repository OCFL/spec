## Version 1.1.1 of the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) Released

**8 November 2024**

The OCFL Editors are pleased to announce version 1.1.1 of the Oxford Common File Layout specification. This
revision provides minor clarifications based on implementation experience and community feedback. Version 1.1.1
updates the specification but does not create a new version for OCFL Storage Roots or OCFL Objects.

### What new information is available?

The [OCFL Specification v1.1.1](https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/) defines both OCFL Objects, a simple structure for content and
a JSON document (`inventory.json`) which provides a straightforward but comprehensive register for the object and
versions of its content, and an OCFL Storage Root, an arrangement for how OCFL Objects are laid out on physical storage.
It also contains examples illustrating the use of the OCFL, and explanations that ground decisions in prior experience.

The companion [OCFL Implementation Notes v1.1.1](https://ocfl.io/1.1/implementation-notes/) contains advice for implementing
the specification including recommendations for digital preservation, storage handling, client behaviors, and best
practices for dealing with OCFL Objects in motion.

The OCFL Editors are also releasing updated [validation rules](https://ocfl.io/1.1.0/spec/validation-codes.html) and
additional [fixture objects](https://github.com/OCFL/fixtures) for testing OCFL implementations against the specification.

There is an accompanying [Change Log](https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/change-log.html) that details the changes from version 1.0
to version 1.1.0 and version 1.1.1. It is designed to assist implementers with updates to their implementations. We welcome
your feedback, questions, use cases, and especially details of any implementations or experimentation with OCFL.

The previous OCFL version 1.1, now 1.1.0, documents remain available:
[OCFL Specification v1.1.0](https://ocfl.io/1.1.0/spec/),
[OCFL Implementation Notes v1.1.0](https://ocfl.io/1.1.0/implementation-notes/), and
[Change Log for v1.1.0](https://ocfl.io/1.1.0/spec/change-log.html).

## Soliciting Feedback on Use Cases for Version 2 of OCFL

**30 October 2023**
Last month the OCFL Editors met in Chicago to review use cases related to the OCFL specification. During that meeting we refined and updated use cases and selected a list of potential use cases we might address in version 2.0 of the specification. Those use cases have been tagged as *Proposed: In Scope* in the OCFL use cases repository.  Below is a list of the use cases:

- Issue #46 [Collapsing OCFL Object Versions](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/46)
- Issue #45 [OCFL as a formal standard](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/45)
- Issue #42 [Support physical file-level deletion](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/42)
- Issue #43 [Defining a repository from peer storage roots](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/43)
- Issue #39 [Distributed Storage of objects and components](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/39)
- Issue #44 [OCFL Object Forking](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/44)
- Issue #33 [Package per version storage](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/33)
- Issue #14 [Flagging file loss/corruption](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/14)

We are now soliciting feedback on these use cases.  You can provide feedback by reviewing each use case and its associated comment thread. We welcome continued feedback via the comments.  You can also provide feedback via the poll added to each use case (see this poll as an example).

We will make space in the next two community meetings to discuss questions or feedback related to the use cases.

## Community Listening Sessions for Version 2 of The Oxford Common File Layout

**1 August 2023**

In July of 2020, version 1.0 of the OCFL specification was released followed by version 1.1 in October of 2022.
We are now beginning to consider additional use cases and revisions that will lead to version 2.0 of the specification.

In addition to gathering feedback via issues and use cases, we would also like to gather feedback and new use cases from
the community through conversation. To that end we will hold a series of listening sessions, we invite all individuals who
have implemented or are interested in The Oxford Common File Layout to attend.

Below are the dates and times for the listening sessions:

## Version 1.0 of the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) Released

**07 July 2020**

The OCFL Editors are pleased to announce version 1.0 of the Oxford Common File Layout, reflecting over 24 months of
work by the OCFL Editors and the digital preservation and technology communities.

The initiative originated in September 2017 from informal discussions at a Fedora/Samvera camp in Oxford, UK. These
discussions identified the need for a simple, non-proprietary, specified, open-standards approach to the layout of
files for the purpose of preservation persistence. Subsequently, a kickoff community meeting attracted 47 attendees
from 32 institutions, confirming the need and resulting in the establishment of the OCFL Editors team.

### What is OCFL?

The OCFL describes an application-independent approach to the storage of digital information in a structured,
transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term object management best practices within
digital repositories. In addition, the OCFL's standardized approach facilitates the migration or transfer of content
between applications that utilize the specification.

The key design goals and benefits of using the OCFL are:

 - Completeness - A repository can be rebuilt purely from the files it stores.
 - Parsability - By humans and machines, to ensure content can be understood in the absence of the original software.
 - Robustness - Against errors, corruption (accidental or deliberate), and migration between storage technologies.
 - Versioning - Repositories can make changes to objects but their history persists - to allow referential integrity
and recoverability.
 - Storage diversity - Content can be stored on diverse storage infrastructures including cloud object stores.
 - Efficiency - Many design decisions are made with a view to computational, bandwidth and storage efficiency in the
light of real world experience.

### What information is available?

The OCFL website at https://ocfl.io, includes the most up to date version of the specification and the implementation
notes as well as the latest editors draft.

The [OCFL Specification](https://ocfl.io/1.0/spec/) defines both OCFL Objects, a simple structure for content and a JSON document (inventory.json)
which provides a straightforward but comprehensive register for the object and versions of its content, and an OCFL
Storage Root, an arrangement for how OCFL Objects are laid out on physical storage. It also contains examples
illustrating the use of the OCFL, and explanations that ground decisions in prior experience.

The companion [OCFL Implementation Notes](https://ocfl.io/1.0/implementation-notes/) contains advice for implementing
the specification including recommendations for digital preservation, storage handling, client behaviors, and best
practices for dealing with OCFL Objects in motion.

The OCFL Editors are also releasing [validation rules](https://ocfl.io/1.0/spec/validation-codes.html) and
[fixture objects](https://github.com/OCFL/fixtures) for testing OCFL implementations against the specification. We
welcome your feedback, questions, use cases, and especially details of any implementations or experimentation with OCFL.

### How can we get involved?

The OCFL is managed through Github at https://github.com/OCFL and it is open for anyone to raise issues or add use
cases. The OCFL Editors meet twice monthly with Community Meetings once a month detailing progress and giving the
opportunity to discuss issues verbally. Details can be found on the OCFL wiki, https://github.com/OCFL/spec/wiki,
which also contains links to the Slack channel and mailing lists.
