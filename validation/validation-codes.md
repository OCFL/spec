# OCFL Validation Codes

## Requirements

 - Levels of validation: ERROR, WARNING, INFO. The ERROR level corresponds with MUST in the specification, the WARNING level corresponds with SHOULD in the specification, and the INFO level is validator implementation specific.
 - OCFL Spec should define error codes to which validators MUST refer; these error codes will refer to sections in the OCFL Spec.
 - Validators MUST validate OCFL Objects
 - Validators MUST validate OCFL Storage Roots
